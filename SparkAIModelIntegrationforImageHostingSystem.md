# Spark AI Model Integration for Image Hosting System

## Core Features

- Replace existing AI with Spark Lite model

- AI-powered semantic search through tags and descriptions

- Language understanding for image filtering

- Enhanced search functionality with AI comprehension

- Non-streaming response for search operations

## Tech Stack

{
  "Web": {
    "arch": "vue",
    "component": null
  },
  "Backend": "Java Spring Boot with Spark Lite HTTP client",
  "AI Service": "iFlytek Spark Lite Model for semantic search",
  "Database": "MySQL with existing tags and descriptions",
  "Storage": "Multi-cloud storage (existing)"
}

## Design

Replace existing AI search with Spark Lite integration. When user searches, system retrieves all image tags/descriptions, sends them to Spark AI for semantic filtering based on user query, then returns relevant images.
